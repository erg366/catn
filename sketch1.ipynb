    "In lieu of a blog post, this notebook also functions as documentation for this sketch. My goal for the project was to think about my own preconceived notions of a story and use Tracery to generate stories that fall outside the classification of the Hero's Journey. According to the definition established by H. Porter Abbott in \"Defining Narrative\", any event or series of events can constitute a story, even when these events are not causally related. Based on this interpretation of what makes up a story, we could generate, without much adherence to any rule that concerns <i>plot</i>, a series of noticeably different stories in which every entity and event, however disjointed, is constituent."

    "In the supplementary readings, I found the Spindlewheel bot, which was built using the Tracery framework, to be particularly compelling. I really like the idea of an interpretive game that allows the players to themselves be storytellers, by offering direction in plot and tone without enforcing a strict set of rules. The Spindlewheel minigame <i>How to Build a Place You Love</i> by Takuma Okada allows the player to create a setting and explore it using the cards supplied by the bot as guiding elements. The dialogue between the player/storyteller and the bot/rules allows for a setting/story that feels both like an intimate product of the player's imagination and something separated from them by a somewhat formal system."

    "The questions asked, or the elements of the story that we use the impressions above to determine, belie the desire for or favoring of a certain type of plot, development, or conclusion. In order to move away from the idea of the hero's journey, and instead situate a character within a larger community and its motivations, and explore a series of events without necessitating conflict, I have tried to ask questions that create interest not through the character's movement throught the story, but the storyteller's or audience's movement through the narrative. Though <i>Her Story</i> has moments of conflict and resolution, the real tension and relief is created by the fact that the player is constantly readjusting their interpretation based on an incomplete but growing pool of information. In <i>Still Eating Oranges'</i> <a href=\"https://stilleatingoranges.tumblr.com/post/25153960313/the-significance-of-plot-without-conflict\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the significance of plot without conflict, they argue that the reconciliation of a surprising event or element with the previously established world creates a satsfying moment of tension and conclusion. The framing of a story based on a structure more similar to these frameworks than the Hero's Journey could work like this:"
